#Successfully completed my internship using Python in PyCharm, gaining hands-on experience with libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. During the internship, I worked on API integration to collect and process data, created meaningful data visualizations, and developed automated reports for clear data presentation. I also built a basic chatbot application and implemented machine learning models for prediction and classification tasks. This experience helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis, automation, and practical problem-solving, while improving my understanding of real-world applications of Python and machine learning.
